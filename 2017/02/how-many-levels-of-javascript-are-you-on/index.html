    <p>There’s a short comic floating around the Twitterverse that pokes fun at
Functional Programming nerds. It’s often on my mind because I find it absolutely
hilarious. It’s a subtle, subversive, and surreal kind of comedy. I can’t
exactly explain why I find it so funny, but I do.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/profunctoroptics.jpg" /></p>
<p>Like so much great comedy, it illuminates some aspect of our culture that needs
to be addressed, or at least taken less seriously. Haskellers have a reputation
for indulging in the use of esoteric language; <em>monad, endofunctor,
zygomorphism, etc.</em></p>
<p>While Haskell nerdery is ripe for mocking, it isn’t alone. JavaScript by
comparison is a seemingly bottomless pit of comedy fodder, but not quite in the
same way. The culture around Haskell is a bunch of good ideas, taken a bit too
seriously. The culture around JavaScript is that of starting with some dangerous
ideas, and piling on layer after layer of external fixes to make the language
work properly.</p>
<p>Come with me on a journey.</p>
<p>JavaScript doesn’t gives us a proper standard library, so we’ll add in a utility
library like Underscore.js so we can do a bunch of list processing.</p>
<p>Oh, it turns out all of Underscore.js’ function arguments are backwards, so
using these functions the way they’re intended is now kind of awkward. I guess
we can switch that out for Ramda.js or something.</p>
<p>Immutable data sounds far less complicated than keeping track of where state
might change. Luckily, there’s a library for that too. Let’s just cross our
fingers and hope that everyone on the team uses the immutable data structure
library and not the programming language by itself.</p>
<p>I want to express what kind of data should be flowing in and out of all my
little functions without having to write a million isolated tests. I guess
I could use something like JSDoc and add a comment to the top of each function
specifying the names and types of each parameter. I’ll have to trust myself to
just <em>be really careful</em> that the documentation and the actual type signatures
don’t go out of sync.</p>
<p>How about those pesky colleagues of mine though? Those kids are always meddling
with my work; never bothering to update my precious documentation comments. What
about some gradual type system like Facebook’s <em>Flow</em>? Ok, so it’s not totally
reliable. And sure, it doesn’t enforce any kind of rigour — you can explicitly
annotate any function to take <em>anything</em> as an argument, and return an
<em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking of pesky colleagues: what about all those formatting errors that make
it into code review? We’ll need to add linting to our build system. Wait…</p>
<p>A build system! Of course we’ll need one of those. I think Make works well
enough, but, ah… Oh dear. It seems one of my more impressionable colleagues has
been convinced by a curly-haired San Francisco man that JavaScript is
<em>everything</em>, now and forever. So, which of those highly complex and
excrutiatingly verbose JavaScript build systems shall we choose? Hmm…</p>
<p>Our build system will also be good for compiling — or is it <em>transpiling?</em> — our
JavaScript-from-the-future into a language understood by the browsers of today.
Using a language that compiles to JavaScript would be an unnecessary
complication. We should just use plain JavaScript. With added compilation.</p>
<p>We still haven’t gotten around to picking a DOM-diffing library or a <em>Functional
Reactive Programming</em> state store, but there’s only so much that can be done in
a day.</p>
<p>That’s enough poking fun at JavaScript for now. What I do find genuinely
interesting is that a lot of these tools are namedropped in programming
discourse, in a sort of <em>“my dad can beat up your dad”</em> fashion.</p>
<p>This isn’t exclusive to JavaScript, or even programmers at all. This was
standard practice for musicians back when I was one full-time. You could say
you’re quite keen on Neil Peart, and I would enthusiastically recite the names
of drummers who can and do make Peart look like a shaven ape, violently flailing
in the tupperware section of a supermarket aisle.</p>
<p>If it weren’t already clear, I also find it interesting that so many developers
would rather start with a broken thing and gradually try to improve it, than to
start with a good thing (Elm, PureScript, ClojureScript, literally anything but
JavaScript), and just enjoy the benefits of improved performance, fewer (or
a total absence of) runtime errors, a sane dependency system, a standard library
that actually helps you do your job, <em>etc.</em></p>
<p>Are you still using MooTools? You are like a little baby. Watch this. Spread operator.
Destructuring assignment.</p>
<p>How many levels of JavaScript are you on. My dude?</p>
