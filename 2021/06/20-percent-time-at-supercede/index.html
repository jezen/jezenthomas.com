    <p>At Supercede, we only work directly on our product four days a week.</p>
<p>Every other Wednesday we hold <em>Research Day</em>. This is a day explicitly set
aside for everyone on the engineering team to study, investigate, and
experiment with some technology of their choosing. It should ideally be some
kind of technology that could potentially be rolled into our business, but that
isn’t strictly necessary. We’ve looked at things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the performance of our test suite</li>
<li>Delegating more logical safeguards to the compiler</li>
<li>State machine testing with Hedgehog</li>
<li>Nested record updates with lenses in Elm</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Research Days have been broadly successful. Sometimes our experiments have
lead to significant improvements to our product. Sometimes we find ways to help
the whole team iterate faster. Sometimes we find some technology is not viable
at all, and that’s cool too! That’s not a failure. It’s important that every
programmer is afforded the possibility to explore the paths that lead to dead
ends. There are still lessons learned there.</p>
<p>So much of our jobs as programmers is learning and experimentation. This is one
of the major ways we enhance our own skills as individual software writers, and
also it’s often how we come upon better approaches to solving problems for our
employers. It seems the common case in industry is to relegate learning and
experimentation time to evenings and weekends, and I think that’s a shame for a
couple of reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the perspective of the employee: if you’re working hard on your employer’s
product all week, how do you find the energy to continue studying outside
working hours? It’s easy to be too mentally exhausted to pick up that weighty
Haskell tome or apply novel approaches to <em>Advent of Code</em> challenges. If you
aren’t learning, you aren’t growing, and soon after you’re no longer enjoying
your work and you disengage.</p></li>
<li><p>From the perspective of the employer: the preceding paragraph still applies,
perhaps with equally as much weight. If your company is a sweat shop, you
aren’t going to do well with employee retention.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The remaining Wednesdays are designated as <em>Open Source Day</em>. The principle
here is somewhat similar — we have dedicated time to contribute back to some of
the open source libraries (mostly Haskell) that we rely on. This is not just
the morally appropriate thing to do, it also works in a pragmatic business
sense. If we’re helping to maintain our favourite open source libraries, it
will encourage other people to do the same and everyone benefits.</p>
<p>A side effect of increasing the amount of work we do in public is that it
forces us to slow down and be more deliberate in our communication. People we
collaborate with outside our organisation are of course going to have less
context into the problems we’re solving, so there’s less opportunity for us to
be terse. Making a habit of communicating with people outside the organisation
will improve the way we communicate with each other <em>within</em> the organisation.</p>
<p>I’m finding that both of our Wednesday traditions at Supercede are helping us
to cultivate the kind of calm and productive culture that I’m looking for in my
working life.</p>
<p>Not only that, but after establishing <em>Open Source Days</em>, the programmers at
Supercede hit the ground running and pretty much immediately started
contributing patches upstream to various libraries, which have since been
merged.</p>
<p>It’s pretty amazing what smart people can achieve when you get out of their
way, allow them to continue maintaining at their own pace the parts of the
product you might not see, and quit hassling them with micro-management
ceremonies like daily stand-up meetings.</p>
