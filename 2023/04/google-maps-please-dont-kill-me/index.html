    <p>Google Maps has a <em>clever</em> feature where it will dynamically reconsider your
route if it thinks it can save you time.</p>
<p>In general, this makes sense. In most cases people would prefer to save time,
and spending less time running an internal combustion engine is better for the
environment. I get it.</p>
<p>What bothers me about this feature is that you <em>can’t turn it off</em>.</p>
<p>I can only assume a product manager in California has decided that <em>Google
knows best</em>, so why would anyone want to turn this feature off?</p>
<hr />
<p>Last year I had to drive from Odessa, Ukraine, to Chișinău airport in Moldova.
Before setting off, I input my destination, and Google Maps dutifully presented
me with a choice of two routes.</p>
<p>I chose the route I found most sensible, even though it’s slightly longer.</p>
<p>While driving, the route guidance drew my attention away from what was
otherwise a rather comfortable journey through Ukrainian vineyards. Google
Maps directed me to leave the road to the Palanca border crossing — a road I
was already somewhat familiar with.</p>
<p>Google Maps had identified a faster route. Google Maps decided to switch me to
the faster route, unless I promptly cancelled the switch by tapping a button on
my telephone within a window of only a few seconds. This prompt is easy to
miss, especially if — as is quite common when operating a motor vehicle — you
are already using your eyes to see where you are going.</p>
<p>The problem with the optimised route Google Maps wanted to guide me towards is
that it runs through Transnistria.</p>
<p>Transnistria is not a real country. It’s actually a sliver of Moldova’s
territory which has been militarily occupied by the terrorist state of russia
since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Google Maps already provides the user with the option to avoid motorways and
tolls. Perhaps Google Maps should also allow the user to avoid wars?</p>
<p>I chose my route specifically because I don’t want to drive towards a barrage
of machine gun fire. I would prefer for my vehicle to have the same number of
holes in it as it did when it came off the production line, and I would indeed
prefer for my internal organs to remain internal.</p>
<p>I understand some Californian environmentalists will be distressed that my
chosen route displaces a few more hydrocarbons, but ideally — if at all
possible — I don’t want to die in a fucking war.</p>
<p>Is that so much to ask, Google?</p>
