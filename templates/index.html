      <h3>Haskell on Rails</h3>

      <h5><span>July 12, 2016</span></h5>

      For years, Rails has been the framework of choice for developers who need
      to <em>Get Things Done</em>. But what happens when the complexity of the system
      inevitably grows? We write tests, and more tests, and even more tests, and
      still we're on our knees, fighting fires and debugging. We need better
      tools. In this talk I show how build web applications with one of the
      fastest and most stable languages in the industry: Haskell.

      <h3>The World's Most Boring Build System</h3>

      The front-end community has matured immensely in the past five years with
      automated build systems and package managers written in JavaScript
      becoming commonplace. But how did we get here? And what has this really
      cost us? We know every line of code is a liability, and the best line of
      code is the one that doesn’t exist. JavaScript build systems are
      complicated and verbose, and it doesn’t need to be this way.

      <h3>Repository Statistics with Git and D3</h3>
      <h4 class="talk-location"><span class="publication-name">Falsy Values</span> — Warsaw, Poland</h4>
      <h5><span>October 12, 2015</span></h5>
      <p>
      A short talk on extracting repository statistics with Git and Bash, and
      visualising the data in a line graph generated with the D3.js JavaScript
      library. This is useful for developing an understanding of how your
      software project is growing and (hopefully!) shrinking over time.

      <h5><span>December 31, 2015</span></h5>
      <p>
      An interview for the Developer on Fire podcast where I chat with Dave
      Rael about great tools, mastering the command line, the primacy of
      simplicity, and geeking out about the rotation axes of the arms when
      typing. Includes rants about JavaScript, stories of failure, and advice
      for broadening your skills as a developer.
