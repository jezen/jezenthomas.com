    <h3>Haskell, But Quickly</h3>
    <p>
    I'm writing a book about building and deploying web applications with
    Haskell and Yesod. The book takes a pragmatic approach, allowing you to
    immediately get your hands dirty and produce something tangible quickly.

    <h3>Haskell on Rails</h3>
    <h4 class="talk-location"><span class="publication-name">Build Stuff</span> — Odessa, Ukraine</h4>
    <h5><span>July 12, 2016</span></h5>
    <p>
    For years, Rails has been the framework of choice for developers who need
    to <em>Get Things Done</em>. But what happens when the complexity of the system
    inevitably grows? We write tests, and more tests, and even more tests, and
    still we're on our knees, fighting fires and debugging. We need better
    tools. In this talk I show how build web applications with one of the
    fastest and most stable languages in the industry: Haskell.

    <h3>The World's Most Boring Build System</h3>
    <h4 class="talk-location"><span class="publication-name">Falsy Values</span> — Warsaw, Poland</h4>
    <h5><span>October 12, 2015</span></h5>
    <p>
    The front-end community has matured immensely in the past five years with
    automated build systems and package managers written in JavaScript
    becoming commonplace. But how did we get here? And what has this really
    cost us? We know every line of code is a liability, and the best line of
    code is the one that doesn’t exist. JavaScript build systems are
    complicated and verbose, and it doesn’t need to be this way.

    <h3>Repository Statistics with Git and D3</h3>
    <h4 class="talk-location"><span class="publication-name">Falsy Values</span> — Warsaw, Poland</h4>
    <h5><span>October 12, 2015</span></h5>
    <p>
    A short talk on extracting repository statistics with Git and Bash, and
    visualising the data in a line graph generated with the D3.js JavaScript
    library. This is useful for developing an understanding of how your
    software project is growing and (hopefully!) shrinking over time.

    <h5><span>December 31, 2015</span></h5>
    <p>
    An interview for the Developer on Fire podcast where I chat with Dave
    Rael about great tools, mastering the command line, the primacy of
    simplicity, and geeking out about the rotation axes of the arms when
    typing. Includes rants about JavaScript, stories of failure, and advice
    for broadening your skills as a developer.
