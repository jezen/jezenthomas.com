A few months ago, I picked up a copy of Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce
A. Tate. It seems as though the book encourages the reader to gradually move
away from verbose, object-oriented languages and towards more terse and
functional languages.

Not only is it fun to learn some new languages, but I also firmly believe that
studying new languages will help me to write better code in languages I’m
already familiar with.

The first language covered in the book is Ruby. This was a great starting point
for me since I already write a bunch of Coffeescript, which borrows a lot of
Ruby ideas and syntax. The book then moves on to Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang,
Clojure, and Haskell. Read along, and follow me on my journey.
