excerpt: A visualisation experiment in Sass using loops and animation.
tags: css

I wanted to create a visualisation by generating style rules with a loop in
Sass. Making art like this is pretty simple; you draw a line, and adjust it
slightly at regular intervals with the loop. The animation is slightly off-sync
relative to the position of each respective line, which creates the effect of
the shape evolving through many interesting patterns.
