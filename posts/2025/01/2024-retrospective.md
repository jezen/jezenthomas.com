Year 2024 has come and gone. Number of bones broken this year — only one.

Here are some other thoughts on how I kept busy.

## Personal

I bought a motorcycle. It's a [Ducati SuperSport 937][ducati]. I didn't think I
would ever like motorcycles, but they've very much grown on me. Part of it is
escapism from a career where I mostly sit in front of a computer. Another part
of it is escapism from traffic and high fuel costs. That and as a machine, it's
really rather pretty.

Cars are always becoming more complicated and more expensive, and as time
marches on manufacturers are further insulating the driver from the driving
experience. Motorcycles don't seem to be following the same trend, so if you
prefer a more immediate and visceral experience, perhaps motorcycles are for
you.

Vehicles aside… My ambition roughly this time a year ago was to commit to
writing more here, which I utterly failed to do. Let's see if I do any better
this year.

## Programming

I appeared on [The Haskell Interlude][interlude] podcast with Wouter Swierstra
and Joachim Breitner. This was a really fun chat, which may have been less
about strictly Haskell and more about business and pragmatism.

I touched on software craftsmanship as described by Gary Bernhardt, and 2024
has been a year that has made me develop a deeper appreciation for abstraction,
decoupling, test-driven design, and keeping tests fast. I'm going to have to
write about this more because I have discovered that these ideas aren't as
prevalent as I had thought. That might be the [curse of knowledge][curse], or
perhaps the software engineering industry is doomed to rediscover the same
ideas over and over through the years. Or it might be a network effects thing —
perhaps the ideas that _software crafstmen_ were excited by over a decade ago
were local to that group, and perhaps in functional programming we just get
excited about different things.

## Music

This was an awesome music year for me.

I saw [Brothertiger][brothertiger] in Berlin, [GZA][gza] (from Wu-Tang Clan)
and later also [Marc Rebillet][rebillet] in Gdańsk. I finally saw [Tool][tool]
live for the first time after being a big fan for 20 years. [Fink][fink] came
to Warsaw to promote their new album. Also playing in Warsaw were [The
Midnight][midnight], which was essentially one big singalong.

One of the artists I listened to the most over the past couple of years is
[Plini][plini], and I saw him in Krakow. Opening for both Tool and Plini was the band
[Night Verses][nightverses], who were _incredible_. Before 2024 I had never heard of Night
Verses, and then all of a sudden I get to see them twice. Joining Plini on
stage was [Jakub Żytecki][zytecki], which was a nice bonus.

Perhaps the biggest surprise, and possibly the greatest live performance I have
ever seen in my life, was the [Mammal Hands][mammalhands] show in Warsaw. If
the Jedi were real and they dedicated their time to music instead of laser
swords, I think it might be these guys.

## Supercede

The startup that I co-founded [raised $15 million][seriesa] in its Series A
funding round, which is an important milestone for the company and an
especially strong signal given the current economic climate where investors are
less eager to invest.

Separately, we finally managed to abandon Jira. I never was a fan, and it turns
out most of the rest of the team aren't either. We now manage all product
development work directly in GitHub. It's not perfect, but it's definitely
easier having a record of what we plan to do and how we plan to do it directly
alongside the work itself. The main benefit I've noticed is that people are
writing more. Specifications and the results of decisions we make as we work
are clearly documented — and are searchable! — in GitHub rather than being lost
into the void that is synchronous meetings or ad hoc Slack discussions.

## Ukraine

I was living in Ukraine when the russians began their full scale invasion in
2022. I left the country the same morning the tanks rolled across the border,
though I returned later that year and spent a few more months living in the
apartment I was still renting. I continued to visit in 2023 and 2024 as some of
my closest friends live there, and of course owing to the general mobilisation,
they aren't allowed to leave the country.

Needless to say I'm personally invested in the outcome of this war. To help
with the defence, I sent two Mavic 3 Pro drones to a Ukrainian battalion
working in Donbas. One of the drones was partially funded by a few of my
friends (thanks guys!). For the support with equipment, the battalion awarded
me their _Почесна Відзнака_ (honorary award) medal.
