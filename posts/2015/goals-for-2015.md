title: Goals for 2015

excerpt: This will be the year of cashflow and 360 flips.

My favourite heavily-bearded man — [Benjamin Reitzammer][1] — took the
initiative to publish his goals for this year. I think it’s a great idea, and
I’m following suit for a number of reasons:

1. Having my goals written down will help me to maintain focus; I’m not going
   to lose sight of what I want to achieve this year.
2. I’ll be embarrassed and disappointed with myself if I fail to meet my goals
   this year, and publicly exposing what my goals are means I can’t bullshit
myself next year with “Oh yeah, last year was fine, I didn’t have any real
goals…”.
3. Next year I’ll be able to more easily reflect on how my year went, and more
   easily measure how much progress I’ve made personally and professionally.

…And it’s totally true. One of my goals last year was to work all the way
through a book called [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks][3], and I think if I
hadn’t set that goal I’d still be coasting now. I might even still be stuck on
the Prolog chapter! I panicked when I noticed time was passing and not enough
pages were turning. Setting that goal forced me to stop screwing around and
actually put the work in, and I’m ever the richer for it.

## Launch my SaaS

I’m working on a Rails app. It’s relatively mundane, but I believe it solves
real problems and I think that in itself is interesting. There is a company who
have expressed interest in paying real money to use my app as soon as it’s
ready. I’m quite confident there are actually many companies who have been
longing for the software I’m building, but as anxious as I am to finally release
the software after having worked on it for over a year, I’m not comfortable with
charging money for — or even wasting people’s time with — a product that isn’t
rigorously tested. I’m on the right route though; 630+ unit tests and counting!
If I achieve nothing else this year, I *must* ship this product.

I’m not really comfortable talking in detail about the project just yet, lest I
jynx myself (and I’m not even superstitious!), but I will flash the product’s
logo which I had my father illustrate for me. Thanks Dad!

## Stay active

Despite finally being in a financial situation to (kind of) afford to own and
drive [a car that I love][4], 2014 was my best year yet in terms of fitness. I
started running regularly and even started to enjoy it. When I started in
Spring, I struggled to run three kilometres. It took me around 28 minutes, and I
couldn’t make it all the way without slowing to walking-pace to catch my breath.
By the Summer, I was running three kilometres in about fifteen minutes — already
a *huge* improvement. In August during a trip to visit my team in Frankfurt, I
had the spontaneous desire to go running late one evening; I was feeling good
and managed to run a whole 10 kilometres around the city, in almost exactly one
hour! That’s a personal best for me, and it’s the kind of pace I want to keep up
once the snow melts and the days grow longer here. Now that I live in a forest
outside the city, I’m not comfortable going running outside when it’s dark. I’ve
tried running at the gym, but I don’t like the gym (it’s full of weird guys who
love to stand around naked and feign masculinity) and I can’t justify paying so
much money for just running, which really should be free. So, I’ve recently been
visiting Gothenburg’s indoor skatepark.

It’s funny, I’ve always loved skateboarding and I’ve been living in Gothenburg
for about six years, but until recently I had never visited the indoor
skatepark. I can still do a few [simple tricks][5], but my goal this year is to
consistently land big 360 flips off kickers/hips/whatever. There’s also a really
nice long rail at the skatepark, and I’d love to hit it at full speed and
boardslide the whole thing. I’ve so far managed to cleanly land a boardslide
across the last quarter of the rail; I’ll have to work up some courage to do the
whole thing.

Now that I’m skateboarding a little again, my balance should be much more on
form for my upcoming snowboarding trip in Trysil, Norway, in March. I’m probably
going to be spending 80% of my time in the park (as I usually do), and my goal
for this year is to finally land a big *clean* 360. That’s all.

## Read a stack of books

I have a pile of books near my desk. They are staring at me, making me feel
perpetually guilty for not reading them. They’re good books too; books I have
been thoroughly enjoying reading. I need to employ my tunnel-vision — a
productivity tool I often reach for — and just plough through the books one at a
time, start to finish. The three that I *must* read are:

- Culture & Empire — *Pieter Hintjens*
- The Master and Margarita — *Mikhail Bulgakov*
- What If? — *Randall Munroe*

I was given a copy of Culture & Empire by the author when I met him at the
Build Stuff developer conference in Vilnius, Lithuania. Hintjens is a
fascinating guy, and the first third of his book that I’ve read taught me much
about the world that I didn’t know, and more still about myself and my
personality and behaviour that I hadn’t ever deeply reflected upon.

My copy of The Master and Margarita was a Christmas present from my father. When
I say “Christmas”, I mean Christmas two years ago. My father is Polish, and I
think Russian literature is just part of the deal of having Polish family. The
book is actually very funny and plays right into my sense of humour.

I’m a fan of Randall Munroe’s XKCD, so of course I have to read through *What
If?*. I didn’t buy one copy. I bought four copies. Three of them I gave away as
Christmas gifts. I’ve read a couple of chapters from the book, and it’s
hilarious.

I *will* read through those three books. If I find time after, I’d really like
to read through my copy of *Algorithms in a Nutshell*. I’ve never been a
maths-nerd, so I think that material will yank my brain open with brute-force,
and with best possible efficiency (both puns intended. Not sorry.) I’d also like
to read Pro Bash Programming, because Bash is a core skill and as a language
it’s interesting in its own way, being at times ugly, at times elegant.

## Invest in the things that won’t change

I found this interesting [quote from Jeff Bezos][6] mentioned a couple of times in
articles and talks by DHH:

> Find the things that won't change in your business and invest heavily in those
> things.

I think that’s especially true in the tech industry. The rate at which
JavaScript frameworks go in and out of style these days is so much of a joke
that I’d rather not participate. How long did Grunt.js last? Is Gulp.js still a
thing? Do people still use Yeoman? The first two are less elegant
reimplementations of Make — a tool that’s been around for *38 years*. The latter
is a solution to a problem I don’t think anyone really ever had. Yeoman gives
you generators for scaffolding projects quickly. But is scaffolding a project
really what we’ve been struggling with over the years?

Over the past year, I’ve becoming increasingly skeptic over the new shiny
things, and I think I’m better off for it. There’s nothing wrong with older
stuff; [in an interview][7] where DHH talks about the old Basecamp, he points out the
negative connotations that a word like “legacy” carries, when in this context
that word can often be used as a synonym for “stability”, which is unarguably a
good thing.

Learning Vim was possibly the best professional decision I’ve made. Learning Vim
in the terminal strongly encouraged me to learn to love the terminal (and I do),
and to embrace the Unix philosophy of composing simple parts that each do one
thing well. Vim has been around for a long time. The editor that Vim improves
upon (Vi) has been around for about forty years. What’s the new thing? Atom?
Isn’t that already going out of style? And what does Atom do that’s so different
from Sublime Text, TextMate, etc…

My goal generally is to learn more well-established tools that I know will be
around forever. I haven’t written any C, and I’d like to change that. I predict
I’ll have more direct use for C than I will for a tool like Haskell in the
coming year, *especially* when I read an article [like this][8]. Git is
relatively new, but it’s well-made and I don’t see it going away any time soon
so it’s worth investing in that. Testing and refactoring and developing an
intuition for which objects are responsible for which behaviour are general
concepts that will help me write better software faster, regardless of what the
software does or what language it’s written in. Kind of a no-brainer, right?

That’s probably enough for now.
