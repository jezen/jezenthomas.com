<span class="run-in"><span class="drop">O</span>n October 12th</span> I gave a
talk at the Falsy Values developer conference in Warsaw, Poland. In the talk I
discussed the idea of abandoning convoluted JavaScript build systems and instead
falling back to the tried-and-true original *Make* utility.

I think the important point to take away from this talk is that most day-to-day
programming work can be solved elegantly with simple tools, and that adopting
the latest shiny thing from the Hacker News and Twitter echo chambers is often
not a wise idea.

This is my first *real* conference talk, and I learned that programmers are shy
and reluctant to laugh at nerd humour. Or perhaps my jokes just aren't that
funny. Either way, several developers approached me after the talk and were
filled with excitement that they could ditch so much code.
