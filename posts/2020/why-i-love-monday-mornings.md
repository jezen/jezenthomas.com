  An exercise in gratitude and inclusivity. An explicit, recurring opportunity
  for everyone on the team to speak up. It costs nothing, and yet it changes
  everything. Try it!

We're not big on meetings or ceremony at Riskbook. We are a team distributed
not only geographically, but also across multiple different time zones. We
don't do daily stand-ups. We favour asynchronous, written communication.

However.

Sometimes some of us can feel pretty lonely. We are all social creatures, and
we can't spend _all_ of our time in social isolation, _crushing_ the problems
in our business domain with _facts_ and _logic_.

To manage this — and aside from ad-hoc, _meaningful_ (_i.e._, not rote)
face-to-face video meetings which we encourage — we schedule _one_ team meeting
at the top of every week.

In this weekly team meeting we talk about developments in the business, we
consider which milestones we've achieved, and we also consider what we ought to
focus on in the near future. Nothing revelatory here.

This isn't why I love Monday mornings. No.

Before we talk about anything business, every person in the company takes a
turn to directly and publicly (within the team) thank one other individual in
the company for _something_ that happened in the previous week.

The rules for this are simple.

1. What you are thanking someone for can be anything, but it _must_ be
   specific. Maybe it's some code contribution. Maybe it's a thoughtful review
   on a pull request. Maybe it's because you love the adorable cat GIFs that a
   colleague compulsively shares around your digital water cooler. It can be
   anything. Whatever makes you happy. But it must be _specific_.
2. It must be _one specific person_. You can't say "This week I'd like to thank
   _everyone_ for just being so cool." If you're thanking everyone, then you're
   thanking nobody in particular. Giving _all_ the kids a prize might work in the
   US, but most of rest of the world recognises that as bullshit.

Specific behaviour. Specific person.

Forcefully soliciting positive feedback from the whole team in this way has
some surprising benefits. People feeling that the effort they've put into their
work hasn't gone unnoticed is a pretty strong motivator to continue to do the
same. Likewise, explicitly and publicly thanking someone for some behaviour
that you appreciated is a good way for that behaviour to not only continue to
occur with the person you are thanking, but _also_ to manifest itself among
other people on the team. This is how good ideas spread. This is how a healthy
working culture is cultivated.

Another surprising benefit of this process is that it effectively holds a
mirror up to your purpose at this job. If you can't think of a _single_ thing
each week that you _genuinely_ — and it _must_ be genuine; people know office
politics when they see it — appreciate from a colleague, then why are you on
the team?

Going through this process every Monday morning makes us constantly consider
why we're here, why we're working on this, and why we're working with these
people. It strengthens our social bonds — an exercise which seems wildly
undervalued in our industry — and I have found that not only is it a highlight
of _my_ week, but it's a highlight of other people's too.

That is why I love Monday mornings.
