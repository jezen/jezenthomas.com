excerpt:
  There are many wonderful places to be in the world, but few that are nice to
  be in year round, at least in terms of climate and economics. I'm using a few
  specific tools to help navigate this.

I am currently in _Perpetual Traveller_ mode, living out of a suitcase and
slowly drifting around the world while running my business. This is made easier
by an array of tools and websites which I think are wildly underappreciated.

What follows are some indispensable tools for the travelling hacker. And no,
this isn't some clickbait-y listicle. There isn't a single affiliate link here.

## Global heat map

Exactly where I travel to is largely dictated by weather and cost. I think the
easiest way to coordinate this is by making a rough plan of where you want to
be over the next several months, with weather being the first data point to
filter on. After all, there are plenty of wonderful places in the world, but
there are very few that are pleasant all year round. Those that are, _e.g._
Monaco, are usually prohibitively expensive. So the first question is:

> Where in the world is the weather nice in March?

To answer that question, I use this interactive [global heat map][0] on
Tableau. You choose an acceptable temperature and precipitation range, and a
week of the year, and it shows all the places in the world that fit within
those desired ranges.

</figure>

Once you know _roughly_ where you want to be in a given month, you can start
whittling down further by things like cost and culture. The image above
suggests I'll want to be in the southern hemisphere in March, but _where_
exactly? Well, I know the US is relatively expensive so I'll give that a miss.
I _assume_ Mexico is quite expensive because the tourists who travel there are
probably mostly US citizens, and thus have money. I don't know much about South
America, but there appears to be significant political unrest. It's also quite
far from where I am now. Much of MENA is quite dangerous and not exactly
culturally liberal (though I look forward to returning to Morocco at some
point). India and Sri Lanka both seem promising. South-East Asia would be an
ideal choice. Australia is too far, too expensive, and currently on fire.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I'm flying to Thailand next week. I'm not too concerned
about the Coronavirus; judging by the numbers the mortality rate is quite low.

It's important to remember that while it's a good idea to stay abreast of
what's happening around the world, media sensationalism sells copies. Read, but
don't be consumed by it. The world is _not_ going to end in 12 years. We
_won't_ all die from this new virus. We are _not_ on the brink of World War
Three.

## Numbeo

Travelling somewhere is _one_ part of the cost equation, but actually _being_
there is another. I can comfortably afford a train ride from Poland to
Switzerland — and I _love_ Switzerland — but living there longer term would be
a struggle financially. I use the Cost of Living Comparison tool on
[Numbeo][numbeo] to try to understand how far my dollar will go.

</figure>

Speaking of finances, you can sometimes make your dollar stretch even further
if you're willing to get creative, and you don't even need to be a
couch-surfing hippie. House-sitting is a potential way to live rent-free (often
in _very_ nice properties in idyllic locations). Sometimes this involves taking
care of the owner's pets.

Another option — if you don't suffer much from seasickness, and you can work
with only a semi-reliable internet connection — is going sailing. There are
plenty of people with boats but nobody to sail with. There are sites like [Find
a Crew][findacrew] that connect aspiring deckhands with boat-owners.

If internet connection is a major obstacle to the latter option, consider this
anecdote: I chartered a yacht between Athens and Mykonos for a week, and I had
reliable, fast WiFi — faster than any mobile connection I've ever had in the UK
— in the middle of the sea all week. I wrote code and worked as normal while
sitting under the stars on top of a catamaran while keeping watch on my
night shift.

I still don't know where that WiFi signal came from.

## Scott's Cheap Flights

I'd rather not fly if I can help it, but I'm not yet in a position — not
financially _nor_ temporally — to afford to travel everywhere by train. You
know how everyone wants to make millions and then sit on a beach and plough
through Mojitos? Not me. I want to make millions and then travel by train from
Scotland to Singapore.

So that only leaves flying (it's a sad time we live in where there are fewer
options to travel by cruise ship). There are many potential _travel hacks_
around flying, but to be honest I don't know of many. One thing I _did_ make
use of was a service called _Scott's Cheap Flights_. You would sign up, and
they would send you an email every so often with extraordinarily low prices on
long distance flights.

Unfortunately for some reason SCF has stopped sending me deals; I think because
my "global base" is Europe. That's why I'm not linking to them. However, I'm
quite sure they had a number of competitors, so with a bit of searching you're
bound to find a service that fills this need.

For an idea of the potential savings, I usually pay around £800 for two return
tickets to Bangkok from somewhere in or around Europe (usually Warsaw, Kyiv, or
Moscow). The SCF service once sent me a deal for the same price between Kyiv
and Bangkok, but in _business class!_ When you're travelling for 16 hours, that
kind of upgrade makes a world of difference.

## Seat 61

Mark Smith is the hero we need, but not the hero we deserve. I _love_ [The Man
in Seat 61][seat61]. It's one of my favourite websites, and it's made in such a
way that can really only be done by someone who cares deeply about their work.
I refer to this website _all the time_.

Train travel is my preferred way of moving around a continent, especially when
it's an overnight trip and you have your own compartment to sleep in as you
gently roll through the countryside. Exactly where you are in the world makes
all the difference, of course. The trains in Europe are wonderful. The trains
in the UK are an embarrassment. In Poland you can ride on the Pendolino for a
few hours between Gdynia and Warsaw for €30, and sit in the restaurant on the
train with a cold beer and a delicious schnitzel made by the on-board chef. In
the UK, a ticket for the same distance will cost you more than three times
that, and the "meal" you'll get for the same price will be a burning hot
microwaved panini. Garbage.

A couple of years ago I visited Amsterdam for one night to see a Nine Inch
Nails concert. I wanted to travel east again the following day, but it was
tough finding a reasonably economic way of making that work. Perhaps by train?
No. Expensive. Fly to Berlin, and then a train to Warsaw? Ends up costing about
the same. So, I go have a look on Seat 61 for some insider knowledge.

Written on one of the pages is this gem.

Genius!

My girlfriend and I used this opportunity to go and visit Prague for a few days
before continuing by rail to Poland.

## sshuttle

Sometimes governments like to try to stop citizens from viewing some online
content. That can for example be because they have a dispute with a particular
organisation, or because they don't morally accept some kinds of content. I am
currently in Russia where the government has blocked not only specific sites
like LinkedIn, but also millions of random IP addresses. A few weeks ago I was
in Turkey where for a few years until just _two_ weeks ago, Wikipedia was
blocked.

I need Wikipedia to do basic research on countries I'm considering travelling
to, and I need LinkedIn to mock recruiters who tell me I am "the first person
who came to mind" for some crappy JavaScript job where I have to sit in an
office in London.

There are various virtual private networks I could use to circumvent these
blocks (though many are terrible and also not free), and perhaps I could even
use Tor (though I've never tried), but the solution I'm currently using is
[sshuttle][sshuttle]. You just point it at some remote machine you can SSH
into, and all your traffic is tunneled through there instead.

Use it like this:

```
sshuttle -r jgt@my-remote-machine 0.0.0.0/0
```

Somewhat related: I sometimes need to work around WiFi hotspots that enforce a
time limit on your usage. I've found [changing my MAC address][mac] is often a
good way to get around that.

## NixOS & a remote builder

Because I travel often, machine portability is important. I _still_ work on a
MacBook Air (though I wish I could have a slightly smaller form factor, like
the old 11" Air). In fact, the equipment I use to do my job is almost _exactly_
the same as when I wrote about it [over six years ago][setup]. I even use the
same pair of big Bose headphones! Buy better quality stuff and you'll save
money, because it'll last longer.

The problem though is that ~~I spilled some exquisite Georgian red wine in my
laptop and now my keys are sticking~~ this machine is a bit underpowered for the
kind of work I do. I write Haskell full-time, and I've spent a significant
proportion of the last few years sitting around and waiting for GHC to compile
stuff.

What's more, my Haskell projects run on Linux servers. I work on MacOS, which
has a completely different architecture. You can't compile a Haskell program on
a Mac and run it on a Linux machine. For a long time, I ran NixOS locally
inside Docker just to be able to compile stuff before deploying it. This was a
_miserable_ experience. I don't recommend it.

A few months ago, I invested in setting up [Cachix][cachix], [Hercules
CI][hercules], and a build machine on [Hetzner][hetzner]. For €40 per month, I
get a beefy machine to do my bidding. I'm renting a dedicated machine with 64
GB DDR4 RAM, and now compiling my Haskell projects is _so much faster_. This
was a _huge_ quality of life improvement, and now after Riskbook compiles in 8
minutes instead of about an hour, I can deploy it to our AWS EC2 machines in
under 20 seconds with NixOps.

I have since removed all traces of Docker from my machine.

Thanks to Domen Kožar and Robert Hensing for helping me with this, and all the
nice people at NixCon in Brno for being cool.

## Email

My preferred method of communication is by email. It works everywhere in the
world, it's asynchronous, and I can use it to organise all my travel documents
and other miscellanea. Just having a Gmail account wouldn't quite cut it for my
purposes though. I often need to reference archived mail without an internet
connection, which means all mail data must be synchronised and stored locally.
I use [mbsync][mbsync] for this, which is sometimes called _isync_.

I'm using _mutt_ as my local email client, and I compose all my emails with the
same tool I use to do all of my other writing: _vim_. I can search through
archived mail using _notmuch_, and the job of sending email is handled by
_msmtp_.

I no longer host my own email on Google, because:

1. I don't trust an advertising company to not capitalise on the contents of my mail.
2. They don't implement IMAP folders correctly.

Instead, I actually _pay money_ to a service called Fastmail. Synchronisation
is significantly faster than it ever was with Gmail, and I'm happy enough with
the service to continue paying them.

You need to be somewhat a masochist to set all of this up nicely, but I'm not
willing to compromise on a tool which coordinates so much of my work and life.

---

Naturally there are a number of other tools I use for managing my work and life
in general, but those are more generic, _e.g._, Trello and Slack. I will say
though that I don't favour that kind of ephemeral communication, and over the
years I've become increasingly attracted to long-form written communication
like they recommend in the Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson books.

Do you know of a good tool or website that I'm missing? Let me know!
