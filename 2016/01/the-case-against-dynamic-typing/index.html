    <p><span class="run-in"><span class="drop">A</span>n argument for dynamic
typing</span> is that by not enforcing the types of a function’s parameters, the
function becomes more generalised, and thus more flexible and reusable. I argue
that this flexibility versus automatically-verifiable correctness of the system
is not a trade-off we need to make.</p>
<p>This post is in part inspired by <a href="http://blog.extracheese.org/2006/12/why-dynamic-typing-is-useful.html"><em>Why Dynamic Typing Is Useful</em></a> by
Gary Bernhardt. I’ll concede that his post is published 10 years prior, so I’ve
had plenty of time to build a counter-argument.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-dynamic-types-useful">Why Are Dynamic Types Useful?</h3>
<p>To maintain sanity, programmers enforce rigid constraints over the parameters
their functions can consume. If my <code>process_many</code> function takes some <code>things</code>,
then dagnabbit; <code>things</code> better be an array! How else will I <em>know</em> that I can
send array-flavoured messages to it?</p>
<p>A core language feature of Ruby is <em>duck typing</em>, where essentially the exact
type of an object is disregarded in favour of the more pertinent question:
“Object, do you understand the message I’m sending you?”. It’s neat way of doing
polymorphism.</p>
<p>It’s easy to take for granted how well this maps to a normal person’s perception
of the world. When you learn how to drive a car, your skills aren’t exclusively
applicable to a car. Your physical output is just as effective when directed
towards a truck or a golf cart.</p>
<p>A code library author shouldn’t need to anticipate every type of parameter that
might be thrown at a function, and a programmer who comes to consume the
function will likely be creative enough to use the function in ways the author
hadn’t expected. Dynamic typing allows for all of this.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-dynamic-types-painful">Why Are Dynamic Types Painful?</h3>
<p>The correctness of a dynamically-typed system is at the whim of the developer’s
discipline and vigilance. And therein lies the rub. If test-cases aren’t
accounted for, it’s the programmer’s fault. Same deal if an interface goes out
of sync.</p>
<p>Even people who advocate most strongly for dynamic typing program defensively.
If dynamic typing filled you with confidence, would you be littering your code
with <code>responds_to?</code> or <code>nil?</code>?</p>
<p>The code library author relies on writing isolated tests with various kinds of
inputs to ensure the robustness of the function. The function’s consumer relies
on some sort of JavaDoc-style documentation comment which is likely to go out of
sync with the function’s <em>actual</em> signature. Both rely on the rigour of humans.</p>
<p>If your code relies on JavaDoc-style comments, the machine isn’t being used as
well as it should. Ideally, a function’s signature should be verifiable at
compile time.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-solution">What Is The Solution?</h3>
<p>A smarter type system.</p>
<p>The argument for dynamic typing doesn’t account for languages that provide <em>type
classes</em>. Granted, there aren’t many languages that support type classes —
Haskell does, Scala does, and apparently Rust does too. In Haskell for example,
you might have a type class named ‘Traversable’, and any data type that can be
traversed over would be an instance of the ‘Traversable’ type class.</p>
<p>This means that instead of saying “this function takes a list”, and then having
to account for the possibility that the consumer might want to pass in a
dictionary instead, you would say “this function takes anything that can be
traversed over”. That way, you have the flexibility of dynamic types, and the
sanity of compile-time verifiable function signatures.</p>
<h3 id="if-dynamic-types-are-no-good-why-are-they-so-popular">If Dynamic Types Are No Good, Why Are They So Popular?</h3>
<p>JavaScript only provides one type of number (64-bit floating point), though
people still do monetary calculations with it. Popularity is seldom a good
indicator that something is of good quality.</p>
<p>It’s evident that those using dynamic languages in anger are shying away from
dynamics despite the supposed flexibility it provides. A few examples which come
to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby 3 looks to be implementing some type of static/gradual typing system.</li>
<li>Haskell is increasingly being adopted by the world’s most front-running tech
companies.</li>
<li>TypeScript and Facebook’s Flow type-checker are gaining traction.</li>
</ul>
