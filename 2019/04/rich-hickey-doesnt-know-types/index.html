    <p>Clojure inventor Rich Hickey is known for his eloquence. His talks like <em>Simple
Made Easy</em> are often cited as a favourite when you ask seemingly any savvy
programmer.</p>
<p>There’s something about the dulcet tones of his radio-smooth voice that brings
a little more magic to any kind of philosophising about software complexity.
Throw in some light usage of the word “complect”, allow to simmer for five
minutes, and you have a seductive Nigella Lawson flavoured dish, garnished with
a twist of pretentiousness.</p>
<p>This is all well and good until he begins his tired <em>types are bad</em> tirade.</p>
<p>Hickey doesn’t understand types. If he did, he wouldn’t be able to say the
things he says with any shred of intellectual integrity, and I’d rather suggest
he’s displaying ignorance than dishonesty.</p>
<p>More specifically, I believe he doesn’t understand parametricity. I base that
on one of his talks in which he says the following with much exasperation and
furrowed brow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>a -&gt; a</code>; <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code>; It means nothing! It tells you <em>nothing</em>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Rich Hickey, <a href="https://youtu.be/2V1FtfBDsLU?t=4020">Effective Programs</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t know if he meant to say “A to A” (<code>a -&gt; a</code>). Assuming he did, that’s an
easy concept to unpack, and an important step in understanding parametricity.</p>
<p>The first assumption most people make is that a function which takes an <code>a</code> and
returns an <code>a</code> could have <em>any</em> implementation. This seems reasonable enough —
the value could <em>be</em> anything, so perhaps the function could <em>do</em> anything,
<em>right</em>?</p>
<p>No. Not right.</p>
<p>What if the value is a number, like <code>1</code>? Could the returned value be the same
number plus one? It would be the same <em>type</em>, right? Yeah, but then consider
that the idea of “adding one” would also have to apply to <em>any other type</em> of
value, and there are <em>infinite</em> types of values. What would <code>True + 1</code> be?
Exactly. It’d be nonsense.</p>
<p>What about if we keep the same value, but concatenate itself with another copy
of itself? Well, we can’t. A Haskeller might describe this by saying not every
type has a semigroup instance. This essentially just means that not every type
of value can be concatenated. Create more examples like this to your heart’s
content.</p>
<p>This function is also guaranteed not to have any effect on the outside world.
We <em>know</em> it won’t send your Bitcoins to China. We <em>know</em> it won’t open or
close your garage door. We <em>know</em> it won’t hang while waiting for user input.
For any of that to work, we’d need to see some hint of <code>IO</code> expressed in the
type signature.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <em>only</em> thing <code>a -&gt; a</code> could <em>possibly</em> be, is a function that
takes a value and returns the same value unchanged. In Haskell, this is called
the <code>id</code> function (but referred to in speech as “identity”).</p>
<p>This alone is evidence enough that Hickey’s statement of “it means nothing!” is
patently and demonstrably false. As it turns out, there’s an awful lot we
<em>know</em> about a function, without even reading its implementation!</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we’re prepared to unpack his second example of “list
of A to list of A” (<code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code>).</p>
<p>First, an admission: This could <em>technically</em> have infinite implementations,
but not for any reason that Hickey is making any allusions to. It could have
infinite implementations in the sense that you could implement it as the input
alone, or concatenated with itself, or concatenated with itself twice, or
thrice, and so on to infinity.</p>

<span class="c1">-- ad infinitum</span>
</pre></div>

<p>For practical purposes, this distinction is not useful, so it does nothing to
support Hickey’s claim that the type signature <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> “tells you
nothing”.</p>
<p>A second admission: While a function of <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> is considered <em>pure</em> in
Haskell, it could potentially cause the <em>side effect</em> of crashing your program
because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>.</p>
<p>The execution of this program (theoretically, depending on input and other
circumstances) could <em>also</em> push your CPU so hard that your machine overheats,
bursts into flames, and melts into its own little pool of glowing lava. That’d
be one hell of a side-effect.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Again, this distinction is not particularly useful. I include these admissions
in the interest of fairness. I want to be clear that I do not intend to
misrepresent neither Hickey nor the benefits and drawbacks of a good type
system such as the one in Haskell.</p>
<p>Let’s retreat to the realm of the reasonable. Could this function be <code>reverse</code>?
Yeah, sure. You could recursively call this function with all the elements
except the first one, joined with a list of just the first item.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">reverse'</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">reverse'</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">[]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">[]</span>
<span class="nf">reverse'</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="kt">:</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">reverse'</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">++</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Pretty standard stuff. What else could it be? Could it be “Give me the first
<em>n</em> elements of the list?” Yeah, that works. You could also drop the first <em>n</em>
elements of the list.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting at this point that none of the functions we <em>can</em> implement
for this type signature actually touch the <code>a</code> inside the <code>[]</code>. Again, because
of parametricity, we’re not allowed to do that. The rules about what we can do
with <code>a -&gt; a</code> seem small and trivial, but actually this stuff is <em>fundamental</em>.
This principle stacks up with <em>enormously</em> meaningful effect.</p>
<p>What about a shuffle? Can <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> shuffle its elements?</p>
<p>Think about this for a moment. How would this work? Given referential
transparency, what would happen on subsequent calls to this function?</p>
<p>For it to do a shuffle, it would need a random seed. You could either pass that
in, which would make it something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Seed</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>…or you would have to do it in IO, which would make it</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">::</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">IO</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Once again, there are quite many things we can <em>know</em> about what a function can
do just by reading its type signature.</p>
<p>You may begin to believe that since I have so far railed about theory, the
benefits of all this are also only theoretical. That couldn’t be further from
the truth.</p>
<p>As Kris Jenkins said in his talk <a href="https://vimeo.com/302682323">Communicating in Types</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have a type error — and you <em>always</em> get a type error — the question
is whether you get it from QA, or your users, or your compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nature of business is change, and this is especially true in the startup
world where I tend to reside. If you want to make large changes across a system
in a dynamic language without breaking everything, you need to rely on human
discipline to have written all the tests.</p>
<p>Writing these tests manually is never going to be as quick as a compiler
writing them for you. With a good compiler these kinds of changes go from being
nearly impossible to just tedious. Encoding invariants in a type system is far
cheaper than writing tests.</p>
<p>Perhaps when Hickey says things like “it tells you nothing”, he is just using
hyperbole for theatrical effect. If that’s the case, it’s effective — It
certainly got a reaction from me! However I don’t think it’s an effective
method for catalysing thoughtful discussion.</p>
<p>Type systems like Haskell’s aren’t a panacea, and there are <em>some</em> things that
a language with a dynamic type system can do that are harder to achieve in
Haskell (though what this means in the context of a business is a separate
discussion).</p>
<p>That said, I don’t think Rich Hickey compares the two approaches on fair terms.
It isn’t fair to say “type systems don’t help because if you try hard enough
you can break them. What you need to do instead is [lots of hand-waving here]
make things <em>simple!</em>”</p>
<p>If you listen carefully to Hickey when he talks harshly about types, you maybe
identify a number of logical fallacies.</p>
<p>When Rich Hickey dismisses the value of a powerful type system by saying “oh it
doesn’t really work in practice”, is this the <em>Anecdotal</em> logical fallacy?
Because anecdotally, this stuff works for me and for many people I’ve worked
with, <em>in practice</em>. It could also perhaps be <em>Ambiguity</em>, or <em>No True
Scotsman</em>.</p>
<p>And the people defending his take on this? <em>Appeal to Authority</em>.</p>
<p>I say this being totally aware that I may be committing the <em>Fallacy Fallacy</em>,
but I’m yet to be convinced that an accumulation of design aids does not yield
a net benefit.</p>
<p>In any case, writing robust software is pretty tough and I’m happy to take all
the help I can get. Rejecting an entire field of study (like types!) is not
only anti-intellectual, but also does nothing to move the state of our industry
forward. I’d say that’s especially harmful now in a time where software errors
can bring down a couple of Boeing 787 Max airplanes and kill hundreds of
people.</p>
