    <p>Every so often I will inspect the data that I’m storing in a web application
and find columns that are near enough totally unused. This is a strong signal
that the feature which relied on the column is not valuable, and the column along
with the feature can and should be deleted.</p>
<p>This is a good thing.</p>
<p>One of the best moves you can make is to <a href="https://dev.tube/video/Ed94CfxgsCA">delete your code</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>We often talk about reducing the scope of a problem until it fits inside your
head. I think a similar principle often applies with database tables — a page
of results when running <code>SELECT * FROM …</code> should be narrow enough to fit on the
average laptop screen without wrapping.</p>
<p>If the table is too wide, look for columns that share some narrow domain —
narrower than whatever domain is shared by the rest of the columns in that
table. Does your <code>users</code> table have a few columns prefixed with <code>oidc</code> for
<em>single sign-on</em> authentication? Those should probably be in their own table.
Joins are cheap. Normalise earlier.</p>
<p>Sometimes for the sake of expediency people will throw a collection of keys and
values into a single cell, encoded as JSON. I have done this, and I have
encouraged others to do this. This can be all the more tempting given the JSON
operators provided in PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I think this approach has been a false economy. It has most
often caused more pain which could have been avoided with a relatively small
portion of diligence. It may seem like persisting data in a flexible schema is
<em>smaller</em> — perhaps because there are fewer columns in the table or because
less effort is required upfront — but then querying becomes harder, analysis
becomes harder, and data transformation becomes harder.</p>
<p>Finally, language implementation details shouldn’t leak into the database. In
the past — again for the sake of expediency — I have persisted values in the
database with exactly the same representation as Haskell would use when
printing that value to the screen. This means I would see the skeletons of
<code>newtype</code> wrappers in the database, <em>e.g.</em>,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>db=# select customer_id from subscriptions;
                  customer_id
--------------------------------------------------
 CustomerKey {unCustomerKey = cus_Buc4bl7hPFJfcC}
 CustomerKey {unCustomerKey = Cus_LO80QORn3LnNPV}
 CustomerKey {unCustomerKey = Cus_GoRq02qsQbd3st}
</pre></div>

<p>The serialisation for this type is generated by the following Template Haskell:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">derivePersistField</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;CustomerId&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This is enticing because the amount of code is small, but as before, the data
is now harder to work with and the signal to noise ratio is worse.</p>
<p>Writing the persistence instances by hand to wrap and unwrap the inner values
for retrieval and storage respectively might require five times the number of
lines of code, but it would make the <em>problem space</em> smaller.</p>
<p>It’s a little extra work up front, but the benefits of making investments like
this compound over time. And making choices in software engineering is all
about good <em>economics</em>.</p>
