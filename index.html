        I'm the Chief Technology Officer and one of the co-founders of <a
          href="https://supercede.com/">Supercede</a>.
        I primarily work with Haskell/Yesod and Nix, and I have been featured on <a href="https://haskell.foundation/podcast/42/">The Haskell Interlude podcast</a>.

        For the past several years I have been slowly travelling the world while
        working, living in different places for a few months at a time. In January
        2022 I decided to live full-time in Ukraine. Good timing!

        I'm interested in building calm and sustainable companies with minimal
        process, a mostly flat hierarchy, and a lack of bureaucracy. This blog is
        loosely themed around all of the above.

        I occasionally write my thoughts on this website.
