My name is Jezen Thomas, and I am a software developer. I am originally from
London, UK, though I currently live in Gdynia, Poland.

This site is a collection of blog posts outlining some of my thoughts and
learnings on various aspects of software design. These blog posts are probably
interesting to you if you enjoy things like Vim, Unix, Haskell, Ruby, and
JavaScript.

Since beginning my programming career in 2011, I have worked with clients in
Sweden, Germany, Poland, The United Kingdom, and The United States. I have
written sites and applications for several multinational companies in car
manufacturing, marine navigation, security, fashion, sports, design, and
finance.

Elsewhere, I share sarcastic quips about computers being perpetually broken on
[Twitter][twitter], and a photographic highlight reel of my adventures on
[Instagram][instagram]. If you want to get in touch with me, [email][email] is
best.

### Timeline

- **Life** *May ’16* Bought a 1997 Polish Fiat 126 with some spare cash I had
  in my pocket. Within 24 hours of buying it, I burned through the clutch and
  rendered the car immobile.
- **Work** *Aug ’15* Joined UXPin, working full-time on a single-page
  application with React.js.
- **Life** *Apr ’15* Attended the Precision Driving course at Porsche's racing
  school in Leipzig, Germany. Moved to Gdynia, Poland.
- **Life** *Dec ’14* Swapped my Porsche Boxster S for a 2004 Porsche Cayenne S,
  which I later came to regret.

  Gothenburg, Sweden the day I bought it, with the roof down the entire time,
