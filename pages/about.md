My name is Jezen Thomas, and I am a software developer. I am originally from
London, UK, though I currently live in Gdynia, Poland.

Since beginning my programming career in 2011, I have worked with clients in
Sweden, Germany, Poland, The United Kingdom, and The United States. I have
written sites and applications for several multinational companies in car
manufacturing, marine navigation, security, fashion, sports, design, and
finance.

Elsewhere, I share sarcastic quips about computers being perpetually broken on
[Twitter][twitter], and a photographic highlight reel of my adventures on
[Instagram][instagram]. If you want to get in touch with me, [email][email] is
best.

#### About the site

This site is a collection of blog posts outlining some of my thoughts and
learnings on various aspects of software design. These blog posts are probably
interesting to you if you enjoy things like Vim, Ruby, and JavaScript.

In case you were wondering, this site is statically generated by
[Hakyll][hakyll], though previously I used Jekyll. Breaking changes in Jekyll's
URL scheme motivated the switch, along with a desire to climb deeper into the
Haskell rabbit hole. The site is deployed to a content delivery network with a
service called [Surge][surge]. Naturally, I typed it all up in the *one true
editor* â€” not Emacs; the other one.
