      A short talk on extracting repository statistics with Git and Bash, and
      visualising the data in a line graph generated with the D3.js JavaScript
      library. This is useful for developing an understanding of how your
      software project is growing and (hopefully!) shrinking over time.

      <h2>The World's Most Boring Build System</h2>
      <h3 class="talk-location"><span class="publication-name">Falsy Values</span> — Warsaw, Poland</h3>
      <h4><span>October 12, 2015</span></h4>
      <p>
      The front-end community has matured immensely in the past five years with
      automated build systems and package managers written in JavaScript
      becoming commonplace. But how did we get here? And what has this really
      cost us? We know every line of code is a liability, and the best line of
      code is the one that doesn’t exist. JavaScript build systems are
      complicated and verbose, and it doesn’t need to be this way.

      <h4><span>December 31, 2015</span></h4>
      <p>
      An interview for the Developer on Fire podcast where I chat with Dave
      Rael about great tools, mastering the command line, the primacy of
      simplicity, and geeking out about the rotation axes of the arms when
      typing. Includes rants about JavaScript, stories of failure, and advice
      for broadening your skills as a developer.
