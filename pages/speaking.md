The front-end community has matured immensely in the past five years with
automated build systems and package managers written in JavaScript becoming
commonplace. But how did we get here? And what has this really cost us? We know

doesn’t exist. JavaScript build systems are complicated and verbose, and it
doesn’t need to be this way.

<p class="post-date"><span>October 12, 2015</span></p>

A short talk on extracting repository statistics with Git and Bash, and
visualising the data in a line graph generated with the D3.js JavaScript

project is growing and (hopefully!) shrinking over time.

  <span class="publication-name">Developer on Fire Podcast</span>
</h3>

<p class="post-date"><span>December 31, 2015</span></p>

An interview for the Developer on Fire podcast where I chat with Dave Rael about
great tools, mastering the command line, the primacy of simplicity, and geeking
out about the rotation axes of the arms when typing. Includes rants about
JavaScript, stories of failure, and advice for broadening your skills as a
developer. You can listen to the interview [on the Developer on Fire
website][developeronfire].
