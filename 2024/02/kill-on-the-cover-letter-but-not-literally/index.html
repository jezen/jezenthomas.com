    <p>A couple of years ago, I received the following email in response to a Haskell programming job I had advertised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is cheap. I would kill someone for a Haskell job. Thanks for your consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was it. That was the entire email.</p>
<p>The applicant had attached their résumé to the email, and in fairness the résumé showed that this person would bring relevant and valuable experience to the team.</p>
<p>Now, I do love all sorts of humour, and I’m 99.9% certain that rather than being serious, this person was a little trigger happy with the hyperbole cannon.</p>
<p>But on the off chance that they <em>were</em> serious, how could I have it on my conscience that we ended up with a killer on the team <em>even after they told me about it</em>?! Could you imagine that tribunal?</p>
<p>I’m fortunate that when I do advertise a programming job on the internet, I’m inundated with strong applications. All of the best applications take the form of a brief couple of paragraphs in an email which describe why the applicant believes they’re a particularly good fit for the job. This is what I regard as the cover letter. The résumé should still be attached, but it’s the cover letter I’m reading first.</p>
<p>The cover letter sets the tone. It says “this is who I am, this is my understanding of what you’re looking for, and this is why I believe I’m the right choice.”</p>
<p>The cover letter is the perfect place to make the right introduction.</p>
<p>But, come on.</p>
<p>This ain’t it.</p>
