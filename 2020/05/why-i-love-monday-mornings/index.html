    <p>We’re not big on meetings or ceremony at Riskbook. We are a team distributed
not only geographically, but also across multiple different time zones. We
don’t do daily stand-ups. We favour asynchronous, written communication.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Sometimes some of us can feel pretty lonely. We are all social creatures, and
we can’t spend <em>all</em> of our time in social isolation, <em>crushing</em> the problems
in our business domain with <em>facts</em> and <em>logic</em>.</p>
<p>To manage this — and aside from ad-hoc, <em>meaningful</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, not rote)
face-to-face video meetings which we encourage — we schedule <em>one</em> team meeting
at the top of every week.</p>
<p>In this weekly team meeting we talk about developments in the business, we
consider which milestones we’ve achieved, and we also consider what we ought to
focus on in the near future. Nothing revelatory here.</p>
<p>This isn’t why I love Monday mornings. No.</p>
<p>Before we talk about anything business, every person in the company takes a
turn to directly and publicly (within the team) thank one other individual in
the company for <em>something</em> that happened in the previous week.</p>
<p>The rules for this are simple.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What you are thanking someone for can be anything, but it <em>must</em> be
specific. Maybe it’s some code contribution. Maybe it’s a thoughtful review
on a pull request. Maybe it’s because you love the adorable cat GIFs that a
colleague compulsively shares around your digital water cooler. It can be
anything. Whatever makes you happy. But it must be <em>specific</em>.</li>
<li>It must be <em>one specific person</em>. You can’t say “This week I’d like to thank
<em>everyone</em> for just being so cool.” If you’re thanking everyone, then you’re
thanking nobody in particular. Giving <em>all</em> the kids a prize might work in the
US, but most of rest of the world recognises that as bullshit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Specific behaviour. Specific person.</p>
<p>Forcefully soliciting positive feedback from the whole team in this way has
some surprising benefits. People feeling that the effort they’ve put into their
work hasn’t gone unnoticed is a pretty strong motivator to continue to do the
same. Likewise, explicitly and publicly thanking someone for some behaviour
that you appreciated is a good way for that behaviour to not only continue to
occur with the person you are thanking, but <em>also</em> to manifest itself among
other people on the team. This is how good ideas spread. This is how a healthy
working culture is cultivated.</p>
<p>Another surprising benefit of this process is that it effectively holds a
mirror up to your purpose at this job. If you can’t think of a <em>single</em> thing
each week that you <em>genuinely</em> — and it <em>must</em> be genuine; people know office
politics when they see it — appreciate from a colleague, then why are you on
the team?</p>
<p>Going through this process every Monday morning makes us constantly consider
why we’re here, why we’re working on this, and why we’re working with these
people. It strengthens our social bonds — an exercise which seems wildly
undervalued in our industry — and I have found that not only is it a highlight
of <em>my</em> week, but it’s a highlight of other people’s too.</p>
<p>That is why I love Monday mornings.</p>
<p><em>…and I’m not even selling a self-help book!</em></p>
