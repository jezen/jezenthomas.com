    <p>There’s a gear-nerd site online called <a href="http://usesthis.com/">The Setup</a> that
interviews notable developers, designers, artists and engineers, with a focus
on what equipment they use to Get Stuff Done. I’d like to join the fun too, so
here’s some information about my setup.</p>
<h2 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h2>
<p>I use a 13” 1.3GHz i5 MacBook Air with 8GB of memory. I don’t have or need an
awful amount of disk space — my machine is mostly for wrangling text in various
forms. If I need to store anything large, I have a 2TB external disk.</p>
<p>I’ve somehow managed to build a large collection of audio equipment over the
years, but most of it is now redundant since adopting a sort of Bose-or-nothing
stance. I shuffle between QC15s (lifesaver!), MIE2is (mostly when driving), and
some desktop speakers.</p>
<p>I tend not to use a mouse so much, but when I do I have a wireless Logitech.
Not a fan of Android, so I have an iPhone.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-software">And what software?</h2>
<p>I run OSX, but most of my workflow lives in the terminal. I do almost all text
editing with vim, and use <del>Grunt.js</del> simple Makefiles for automating tasks
like processing Sass and CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>I use a neat little tool called <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> to help me
run several terminals at once. This is great for when I need to work on a
couple of machines at once via SSH, or if I want to watch a compile tool like
JSHint.</p>
<p>I use zsh instead of bash, just because it’s a little easier to use. I use both
Git and Mercurial for versioning, and I also use both those tools for
deploying. Very neat little tools indeed.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup?</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time travelling, so portability is probably the most important
factor. Basically if I could have an 11” MacBook Air with Mac Pro performance,
I’d be happy.</p>
